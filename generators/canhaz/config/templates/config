# This is a generated canhaz config file.  Anything you set in
# this file will override the base configuration.

# Default namespace for things to generate
# You can override this and canhaz will fallback to looking in
# this namespace for generators if it can't find the generator
# exactly as specified on the command line
#DEFAULT_NAMESPACE="canhaz"

# The default type of thing to generate
# You can override this to set which generator should be run
# when one is not specified
#DEFAULT_TYPE="help"

# Override output dirs to point to whatever you want.  By default
# canhaz will generate files starting in the current dir.  So only
# set these if you want to override that behavior.
#
# Example 1
# If you want to explicitly specify an output dir and test output
# dir.
# BASE_DIR="/path/to/output/src"
# TEST_DIR="/path/to/output/test"
#
# Example 2
# If you have a custom canhaz config file in your base project dir,
# you can tell canhaz to default to generating output in the parent
# dir of your config.  For example, if your project dir is
# /Users/brian/Projects/thinger
# and you have a custom config at
# /Users/brian/Projects/thinger/.canhaz/config
# using this setting will cause canhaz to generate files to
# /Users/brian/Projects/thinger
# BASE_DIR="$CONFIG_PARENT_DIR"
# TEST_DIR="$BASEDIR/../test"

# Where to find generators
# If you want to keep your generators outside of the canhaz install
# dir, you can point this wherever you want to keep them
#GEN_BASE_DIR="$MY_DIR/generators"

# PHP executable
# This should work in most cases, but if you want to use a particular
# PHP, point to it here.
#PHP="/usr/bin/env php"
